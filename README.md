✅ Perfect — I’ll prepare a **professional `README.md` template** right now!  
It will match your **Document RAG Search** project and look very polished when visitors open the repo.

# 📋 Suggested `README.md` (for your `document_rag_project`)

```markdown
# 📄🔍 Document RAG Project

Offline Document Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system built with:

- **Streamlit** frontend (file upload, semantic query)
- **FAISS** vectorstore for persistent vector indexing
- **LlamaCpp** local model (e.g., Phi-2)
- **HuggingFace embeddings** (sentence-transformers)
- **No external API calls** (purely local operation)

---

## 🚀 Features

- Upload multiple PDF files
- Chunk, embed, and vectorize documents
- Persist embeddings for fast, offline semantic search
- Use a local LLM (Phi-2 or similar) to answer user queries
- Sidebar controls for file management and ingestion
- Full Streamlit app with clean UX

## 🛠 Technology Stack

| Tech | Description |
|:---|:---|
| Python 3.11+ | Programming language |
| Streamlit | Frontend app UI |
| FAISS | Vector similarity search |
| LlamaCpp | Local inference engine |
| LangChain | RAG chaining logic |
| HuggingFace Sentence Transformers | Embeddings |

## 📦 Installation

1. Clone the repo:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/document_rag_project.git
cd document_rag_project
```

2. Create and activate a virtual environment:

```bash
python -m venv venv
.\venv\Scripts\activate
```

3. Install requirements:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

4. Run the app:

```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

---

## ⚙️ Configuration

Ensure the following:

- Local Llama model (e.g., Phi-2) is placed correctly.
- `.streamlit/config.toml` has:
  ```toml
  [server]
  fileWatcherType = "none"
  enableStaticServing = false
  ```

# 📢 Few Notes:

- If you want, I can also generate **badges** (Python version, Streamlit version, License badge).
- We can also add an automatic **Screenshots section** if you want later!

---

# 🎯 Next Actions:

| Step | Action |
|:---|:---|
| 1 | Copy this `README.md` |
| 2 | Paste it into your project root |
| 3 | Add + commit it (`git add README.md && git commit -m "Add README.md" && git push`) |

✅  
Would you also like a **bonus upgrade** after this?  
(Like: Quick badges, or a nice screenshot placeholder at the top?) 🎨🚀

Just say:  
**"Yes, badges please"** if you want it!  
Or **"Yes, screenshot too"** if you want both! 🚀
